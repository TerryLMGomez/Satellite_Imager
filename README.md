# Open_source_maps

- Map that utilizes the Mapbox API to create a Tkinter app that acts as a satellite imager

- Users can adjust the zoom level and the latitude/longitude to get a satellite image of their desired location

- An advantage of this is that is that it is uncensored so you can see anything ;) unlike google maps with has corporate censorship.

- The pictures are quite recent and updated
